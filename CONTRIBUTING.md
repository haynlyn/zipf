# Why Contribute

Given that this is an already free and popular repository (having been spawn from
a textbook whose contents are easily found online), there's no real need for
contribution per se. That being said, perhaps you would like to enrich the
analyses performed here, or facilitate them with auxiliary functionality.

# What to Contribute

I welcome contributions of the following:
1) Texts from Project Gutenberg ("TEXTS")
2) Analytical functions for the above TEXTS ("ANALYSIS")
3) Proposals for changing the project layout; e.g., grouping functions into a file ("PROPOSAL")
4) Proposals for pipelines, storage buckets, data warehouses, etc. ("PROPOSAL")
5) Bug fixes for any of the above ("BUG")

# How to Contribute

If you would like to make one of the aforementioned contributions, please
submit a pull request where the title follows the following format:
(TAG): (small description)

Use the body to write a few sentences detailing:
1) The proposal
2) The problem it addresses (if relevant)
3) The solution it provides (if relevant)
4) A short justifucation of the proposal

Note that a PROPOSAL to, say, add a pipeline for hosting on AWS S3 would address
the problem of *not* having such access. The justification would boil down to
whether or not there were already sufficient means for hosting available in the
project.
